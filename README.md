# Interpreter
Interpreter for a low level Python based language. It's pretty neat. Cannot handle objects though. This was made for CS280, Programming Language Concepts; DO NOT USE THIS FOR THAT CLASS. YOU WOULD BE CHEATING. Also, some of the code, specifically the gettoken.h, and class names/structure was made by Professor Gerard Ryan. Give the man credit where credit is due.
